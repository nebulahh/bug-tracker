 * Checks whether a user may change an issue's status.
 *
 * Allowed: the issue's assignee of record, or an owner / admin of its organization.
 * The site super admin counts. A site-wide admin who is only a member does not.
 *
 * Additionally, the reporter of an unconfirmed, unassigned issue may change its
 * status (e.g. to close it as invalid), since no one else can act on it yet.
 *
 * Note that this is deliberately evaluated against `currentAssigneeId` - the
 * assignee the issue has *now* - and never against the assignee the request is
 * trying to set. Otherwise a user could self-assign an unassigned issue and, in
 * the same request, close it.
